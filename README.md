# Macwinchanger

Tool for change your MAC address in Windows, like macchanger in Linux.

## Before running first time

Edit the file, change the XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX for your real mac, so you can turn back to it.

## Usage

```
powershell -executionpolicy bypass -File .\macwinchanger [-random]
```

Without the -random option you will get your real MAC.
